The Drugs, Side Effects, and Medical Conditions Project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing details about various drugs, their associated side effects, and the medical conditions they treat. The dataset includes information such as drug names, classes, ratings, pregnancy safety categories, and user reviews. Using Python, SQL, and machine learning techniques, the project performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and pattern identification.

Key insights include the most common drugs for specific conditions, frequent side effects, and user ratings by drug class. Visualizations like histograms, box plots, and heatmaps provide a deeper understanding of drug performance and usage trends. This analysis helps uncover valuable patterns, enabling better decision-making in pharmaceutical research and medical practice.
